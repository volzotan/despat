Some phone manufacturers add changes and own software to the android version they ship on their devices.
These phones may behave differently especially when it comes to power save mode. If the app is not working as intended, chances are quite high that some custom battery saving options are enabled which exist only on phones from a specific vendor.

Example ZTE: Settings > Power Manager > Power management for apps > despat : disable "Scheduled background wake-up"

Lenovo: Settings -> Applications -> despat-> disable "Restrict to launch"
